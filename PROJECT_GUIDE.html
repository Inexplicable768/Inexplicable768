      <h2>Project #1 - <span style="color:gold">The Infinistem Project</span> | HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h2>
      <p>My biggest project and my "Magnum Opus" thus far if you will. Infinistem is being worked on whenever I have time, and I have made significant progress completing mostly everything except for all the lessons. Infinistem is a website dedicated to STEM education, Preparidness for the world and future sucess, problem solving, and career exploration & placement. It has games and tools, resources for teachers and so much more to help people</p>
      <h2>Project #2 - <span style="color:blue">GUI Calculator</span> | Python</h2>
      <p>After starting programming when I was much younger about a couple years prior I wanted to do more that just HTML, CSS, and js projects, including the website, so I decided to explore more to computer science and engineering respectivly which is when I fell in love with the feild. My first significant project (note I will probably never post console projects here) was this simple calculator in tkinter with its own parser from scratch. Honestly I laugh looking at this (and keep in mind its been only a few months) and see many ways in which this game be done better. It uses Tkinter for GUI</p>
