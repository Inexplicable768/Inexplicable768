      <h2>Welcome! This is designed as a way to document my progress for each of my individual projects. You will see them listed in order here. Download the HTML file to view it </h2>

      <h2>Project #1 - <span style="color:gold">The Infinistem Project</span> | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Status: Alpha</h2>
      <p>My biggest project and my "Magnum Opus" thus far if you will. Infinistem is being worked on whenever I have time, and I have made significant progress completing mostly everything except for all the lessons. Infinistem is a website dedicated to STEM education, Preparidness for the world and future sucess, problem solving, and career exploration & placement. It has games and tools, resources for teachers and so much more to help people</p>
      <h2>Project #2 - <span style="color:blue">GUI Calculator</span> | Python | Status: Done</h2>
      <p>After starting programming when I was much younger about a couple years prior I wanted to do more that just HTML, CSS, and js projects, including the website, so I decided to explore more to computer science and engineering respectivly which is when I fell in love with the feild. My first significant project (note I will probably never post console projects here) was this simple calculator in tkinter with its own parser from scratch. Honestly I laugh looking at this (and keep in mind its been only a few months) and see many ways in which this game be done better. It uses Tkinter for GUI</p>
      <h2>Project #3 - <span style="color:blue">Paint Application</span> | Python | Status: Done</h2>
      <p>My second project with tkinter was a paint application with your typical tools. A line tool, brush tool, etc. I also added a cool spray brush effect using some simple trigonometry. I also want to come back and add more to this</p>
      <h2>Project #4 - <span style="color:blue">Socket LAN Chatroom</span> | Python | Status: Needs Uploaded</h2>
      <p>To use socket programming in a gui setting I decided to make a chatroom via LAN since its sockets only. It allows image and text sending and loads previous chat records from computer when launched if found</p>
      <h2>Project #5 - <span style="color:blue">Tower of Hanoi</span> | Python | Status: Mostly Done</h2>
      <p>I made the tower of hanoi puzzle on Infinistem before which was exceedingly easy, in less than 50 lines i think. I wanted to make it as an application in python. It is complete with a solving instructions algorithm. I didnt make a solving animation as I though that would be boring unless done super fast, but that defeats the point of learing from it. </p>
       <h2>Project #6 - <span style="color:blue">Suika Game</span> | Python | Status: Mostly Done</h2>
      <p>I made the popular suika game in python. Now looking at the project it of course needs some work, and is not complete. I will eventually return to this and finish it. I used a physics engine, however later I develop my own simple physics calculations</p>
       <h2>Project #7 - <span style="color:blue">Billiards Game</span> | Python | Status: Mostly Done</h2>
      <p>An oppertunity to test physics algorithms and pygame stuff is a simple billiards game! Not complete yet</p>
       <h2>Project #8 - <span style="color:blue">Peg Solitare Game</span> | Python | Status: Done</h2>
       <h2>Project #9 - <span style="color:blue">Poker Game</span> | Python | Status: Mostly Done</h2>
      <h2>Project #10 - <span style="color:blue">Graphing Calculator App</span> | Python | Status: Mostly Done</h2>
      <h2>Project #11 -  <span style="color:blue">Pacman Game</span> | Python | Status: Mostly Done</h2>
      <h2>Project #12 -  <span style="color:blue">Mandelbrot Set Renderer</span> | Python | Status:  Done</h2>
      <h2>Project #13 -  <span style="color:pink">SFML Snake Game</span> | C++ | Status: Mostly Done</h2>
      <h2>Project #14 -  <span style="color:pink">SFML Tetris</span> | C++ | Status: Mostly Done</h2>
      <h2>Project #15 -  <span style="color:pink">SFML Connect 4</span> | C++ | Status: Inpending Start</h2>
