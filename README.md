I would like to at some point use: .NET, C#, Fortran, Lua, or Go

Don't like java for a number of reasons but i will try a project with it

Programming is fun, but remember its important to connect with the real world too. I do that, and im pretty content as a result.

I am documenting a number of projects and you will see frequent uploading. Keep in mind I also am working on the Infinistem Project so I have on and off periods for both
