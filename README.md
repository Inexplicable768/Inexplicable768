**Welcome my name is Alex**

I am a guy who enjoys working on small projects for fun both programming and engineering, as well as learning how things work. My biggest goal is to help others through my website Infinistem.com

- About Me
  
I just post projects I do for fun here. My main thing is infinistem.com which is website I made because I think people seriously
need a better source of education on STEM to help them actually find it fun and to learn and study, check it out.
Check the **Inexplicable768** repository for main information such as a resume, project documentation, and my to do list. I like
Programming, Computer Science, Engineering, Natrulism & survival, Nature, Music, Video Games, Swimming, Tennis & some other sports. 
Besides programming I like to compose and transcribe music, listen to music, play instruments, watch animes, play games and build things
(circuits & mechanical things)

   HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, C++, Python, BASIC, x86 asm, 6502 asm, bash, powershell

I am documenting a number of projects and you will see frequent uploading. Keep in mind I also am working on the Infinistem Project so I have on and off periods for both
